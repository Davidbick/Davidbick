## Hi, I'm David 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida interested in embedded systems, smart environments, and IoT innovation.

I like designing things that sit between software, electronics, and real-world impact.

Most of my technical work, documentation, and projects live here:

Outside of engineering, I care about leadership, community building, and turning ideas into reality.
